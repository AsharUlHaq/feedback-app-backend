feedback min(5).max(500)
which model you used? -> dropdown.field required -> default/deep search/advance deep search
how do you know about fynder ? drop down -> facebook, instagram, linkedin, friends, colleagues, other.

i also want some basic api like user creation, findonebyuserId, findonebyemail.

each module should divided into route,schema,controller,services
